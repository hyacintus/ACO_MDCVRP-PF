README - MDCVRP-PF Experiments

Folder Description:
This GitHub repository contains two main folders dedicated to experiments on the Multi-Depot Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Processing Facilities (MDCVRP-PF):

1. Experiment_5_1
2. Experimenti_5_5

Data Used:
- The data in these folders corresponds to the reference article.
- "Experiment_5_1" contains data described in Section 5.1 "Problem setup and modeling".
- "Experimenti_5_5" contains data described in Section 5.5 "Simulation on real-world data".

Objective:
By using the CSV files present in both folders, it is possible to test the three algorithms developed to solve the MDCVRP-PF problem.

Algorithms:
The three algorithms are located in the same main folder as the experiment folders:
1. `Heuristic.py`
2. `Metaheuristic_1.py`
3. `Metaheuristic_2.py`

Requirements:
- To run `Metaheuristic_1.py` and `Metaheuristic_2.py`, the file `funzioni.py` must also be present in the same folder as the algorithms.

Quick Instructions:
1. Ensure that the folders Experiment_5_1 and Experimenti_5_5 are in the same main folder as the three algorithms and `funzioni.py`.
2. Run the algorithms using the CSV files from the corresponding experiment folder.
3. Analyze the results to compare the performance of the different approaches.
